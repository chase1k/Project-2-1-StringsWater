# Project-2-1-StringsWater

This is the first part of a project that I have completed for my computer science class.
Not all the code was by me, some of the code was made by the instructor adding some functionality that didn't concern what we were learning and the base template for what I coded.

This part of the project taught Graphs and Breadth First Search
